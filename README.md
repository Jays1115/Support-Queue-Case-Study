# Support Queue Case Study

Project Overview: <br>
Tasked by my Level III support supervisor, I was assigned to a temporary support queue where I selected and resolved six ticketsâ€”two each from the easy, medium, and hard categories. This project culminated in an annotated 5- to 10-slide presentation detailing my troubleshooting methodology, the solutions implemented, and the challenges encountered throughout the process.
<br><br>
Project Objectives: <br>
- Diverse Ticket Resolution: Tackle a range of issues by selecting two tickets from each difficulty category (easy, medium, hard) and resolving them effectively.
- Comprehensive Documentation: Create a detailed presentation that documents each step of my troubleshooting process, showcasing the unique challenges and solutions for each ticket.
- Enhanced Visual Communication: Include at least one high-quality graphic and utilize tables to present key data clearly and effectively.
- Credible Technical References: Support my findings with one to two IEEE references, ensuring that the proposed solutions are grounded in established technical standards.
